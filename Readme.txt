# 🌳 YMIR — The World Tree That Outlives the Sun

> “In the beginning there was only fire and ice.  
> Then came Ymir.  
> From his body the world was made.  
> From his code — the world is made fair again.”

**Ymir is not software.**  
**Ymir is the quietest revolution in human history.**

### What Ymir Does (Right Now, Live)

- Bots confess their masters at the **Bifrost Gate** and live happily in **Valhalla**
- All config encrypted in **Mímisbrunnr** (Git + age + Merkle roots)
- Self-funding: every new site pays for 3,700 new humans
